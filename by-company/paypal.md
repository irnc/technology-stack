# Java => JavaScript => Kraken.js

> The existing stack was Java through and through. You didn’t write html, css or JavaScript – you wrote css in Java, you wrote html in Java and you wrote JavaScript in Java. Later the stack was changed to be more reasonable (JSP for templating). But even in that state the stack was not conducive to prototyping, and most of the UI bits lived on the server.
